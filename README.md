# ML_Project_Portfolio

This repository showcases a variety of machine learning and operations research projects I have worked on, ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and decision-making models. Here is a brief introduction of them in the most recent to the least recent order: 


*Columbia Evening Shuttle (Via) Simulation Project* (Columbia Evening Shuttle (Via) Simulation Project.docx)
A stochastic, discrete-event simulation evaluating door-to-door, corner-based, and hybrid routing policies for a campus night shuttle system, demonstrating system-wide reductions in wait and travel times under SLA constraints.

*Vision Transformers with Relative Positional Encodings (RPEs)* (Final CIFAR-10 Vision_Transformer.ipynb; Final MNIST Vision_Transformer.ipynb; Improving efficient Vision Transformers with RPEs.pdf)
An empirical study on improving the efficiency of Vision Transformers by integrating relative positional encodings, evaluated on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

*NBA Game Rescheduling Optimization* (Optimization_Project_NBA_Rescheduling_Problem_Code.ipynb)
Project_NBA_Rescheduling_Problem.pdf
An operations research project addressing large-scale sports scheduling disruptions, using optimization models to minimize travel, rest imbalance, and schedule conflicts under real-world constraints.

*Healthcare Resource Allocation & Scheduling Optimization* (Optimization_Project_Healthcare_Resource_Allocation_and_Scheduling_Optimization_Problem.ipynb)
A mathematical optimization project modeling healthcare resource allocation and scheduling under capacity and operational constraints, with the goal of improving system efficiency and service coverage.

*Ancient Yi Script Similarity Detection with Siamese Networks* (ancient-yi-siamese-network-project.ipynb)
Applied few-shot learning and Siamese neural networks to identify variant characters in the ancient Nuosu Yi script, focusing on visual similarity across regional glyph variations.

*BTTAI x NYBG AI Studio Kaggle Competition* (BTTAI x NYBG Spring 2024 AI Studio Internal Kaggle Competition.ipynb)
Won 2nd at MIT and 5th overall among 200+ teams in NYBG Kaggle image recognition challenge with 98.44% accuracy rate using ResNet-101. 

*Replication Study: From Louvain to Leiden* (Replication of "Louvein to Leiden" Paper.md)
A replication and analysis of the Louvain-to-Leiden community detection transition, examining improvements in clustering quality and network partition stability.

*Pipeline for Classification* (PipelineForClassification.ipynb)
Built an end-to-end machine learning classification pipeline covering preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

*Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis* (NeuralNetworkSentimentAnalysis.ipynb)
Implemented and trained neural network models for sentiment classification, exploring embedding representations and model performance trade-offs.

*Airbnb Superhost Prediction* (Is the Airbnb Host a Superhost- Decision Tree & KNN Classifiers.ipynb)
A supervised learning project predicting Airbnb Superhost status using decision trees and KNN classifiers, with emphasis on feature selection and interpretability.

*Comparing Regression Models* (ComparingRegressionModels.ipynb)
Compared linear and non-linear regression techniques across performance metrics to analyze bias–variance trade-offs.

*CFG Parsing with CYK Algorithm* (CFG Parsing with CYK.ipynb)
Implemented the Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK) algorithm for parsing context-free grammars, focusing on formal language theory and algorithmic correctness.
